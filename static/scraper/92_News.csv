"December 1, 2022",Record-breaking England put Pakistan to the sword in first Test,https://92newshd.tv/about/record-breaking-england-put-pakistan-to-the-sword-in-first-test,https://92newshd.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/6301463.webp,"RAWALPINDI (AFP) - Four England batsmen scored hundreds Thursday as the visitors piled up a record 506-4 on the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. Openers Zak Crawley (122) and Ben Duckett (107) set the tone with quick-fire tons against a hapless Pakistan bowling attack before Ollie Pope (108)and Harry Brook (101 not out) compounded their misery. Ben Stokes was also not out, on 34, when bad light stopped play, having helped England break a 112-year-old record for the most runs on the first day of a Test -- beating Australia's 494-6 against South Africa at Sydney. After winning the toss England went straight into ""Bazball"" mode, the brand of freewheeling, aggressive batting taken from the nickname of head coach Brendon McCullum. England's fiery batting -- with 73 boundaries and three sixes -- lifted the gloom over the start, which hung in the balance Wednesday after several of the tourists came down with a mystery virus. As if the punishment from the top three wasn't enough, Brook -- playing only his second Test -- cracked six consecutive boundaries off one over from debutant spinner Saud Shakeel. He is only the fourth batsman to score six consecutive boundaries in a Test, following West Indians Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan, and Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya. Brook reached his maiden century off just 80 balls, capping a highly entertaining day for a crowd of 6,000 that included around 150 ""Barmy Army"" fans. Brook added 176 for the fourth wicket with Pope, who fell to pacer Mohammad Ali. Pakistan had briefly fought back in the second session when they dismissed Duckett, Crawley and Joe Root (23) in the space of 53 runs, but that was shortlived. Debutant leg-spinner Zahid Mahmood was the most successful Pakistan bowler with 2-160 on a pitch similar to the one used against Australia earlier this year. That pitch was declared ""below average"" by the match referee after it yielded 1,187 runs for the loss of just 14 wickets over five days. Duckett, who hit his maiden hundred after being recalled to the Test side following an absence of six years, was the first to go when he missed a reverse sweep off Mahmood and was trapped leg-before. West Indian umpire Joel Wilson initially ruled it not out, only to change his decision on Pakistan's review. Duckett, who hit 15 boundaries, put on 233 for the first wicket with Crawley -- an England record for the first wicket against Pakistan. It beat the 1962 stand of 198 between openers Geoff Pullar and Bob Barber in Dhaka, then East Pakistan. Crawley was bowled off a sharp incoming delivery by Haris Rauf in the next over, the Test debutant's first wicket. The lanky Crawley hit 21 boundaries in his quickfire 111-ball innings, his third Test hundred. Former skipper Root also fell leg-before to Mahmood, unsuccessfully challenging the decision. Crawley showed his intent right from the start, hitting three boundaries off Pakistan fast bowler Naseem Shah's first over of the match, and bringing up his half-century off just 38 balls. He could have become the first England batter to score a century before lunch on day one of a Test but was left nine short. England are on their first Test tour to Pakistan in 17 years.

"December 1, 2022",China softens tone on COVID severity after protests,https://92newshd.tv/about/china-softens-tone-on-covid-severity-after-protests,https://92newshd.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/6301457.webp,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is softening its tone on the severity of COVID-19 and easing some coronavirus restrictions even as its daily case toll hovers near record highs, after anger over the world's toughest curbs fuelled protests across the country. Several cities in the world's second-largest economy, while still reporting new infections, are breaking with practice by lifting district lockdowns and allowing businesses to reopen. Health authorities announcing the relaxation of measures did not mention the protests, which ranged from candle-lit vigils in Beijing to clashes with the police on the streets of Guangzhou on Tuesday and at an iPhone factory in Zhengzhou last week. The demonstrations marked the biggest show of civil disobedience in mainland China since President Xi Jinping took power a decade ago and come as the economy is set to enter a new era of much slower growth than seen in decades. Despite near-record case numbers, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who oversees COVID efforts, said the virus's ability to cause disease was weakening, state media reported. ""The country is facing a new situation and new tasks in epidemic prevention and control as the pathogenicity of the Omicron virus weakens, more people are vaccinated and experience in containing the virus is accumulated,"" Sun said in comments reported in state media. Sun also urged further ""optimisation"" of testing, treatment and quarantine policies. The mention of a weakening pathogenicity contrasts with earlier messages from authorities about the deadliness of the virus. Less than 24 hours after violent protests in Guangzhou, authorities in at least seven districts of the sprawling manufacturing hub north of Hong Kong, said they were lifting temporary lockdowns. One district said it would allow in-person classes in schools to resume and would reopen restaurants and other businesses including cinemas. Some changes are being implemented with little fanfare. A community of thousands in east Beijing is allowing infected people with mild symptoms to isolate at home, according to new rules issued by the neighbourhood committee and seen by Reuters. Neighbours on the same floor and three stories above and below the home of a positive case should also quarantine at home, a committee member said. That is a far cry from quarantine protocols earlier in the year when entire communities were locked down, sometimes for weeks, after even just one positive case was found. Another community nearby is holding an online poll this week on the possibility of positive cases isolating at home, residents said. ""I certainly welcome the decision by our residential community to run this vote regardless of the outcome,"" said resident Tom Simpson, managing director for China at the China-Britain Business Council. He said his main concern was being forced to go into a quarantine facility, where ""conditions can be grim to say the least"". Prominent nationalist commentator Hu Xijin said in a social media post on Wednesday that many asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in Beijing were already quarantining at home. The southwestern city of Chongqing will allow close contacts of people with COVID, who meet certain conditions, to quarantine at home, while Zhengzhou in central China announced the ""orderly"" resumption of businesses, including supermarkets, gyms and restaurants. National health officials said this week authorities would respond to ""urgent concerns"" raised by the public and that COVID rules should be implemented more flexibly, according to a region's conditions. Expectations have grown around the world that China, while still trying to contain infections, could look to re-open at some point next year once it achieves better vaccination rates among its elderly. Health experts warn of widespread illness and death if COVID is let loose before vaccination is ramped up. Chinese stocks and markets around the world dipped initially after the weekend protests in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities, but later recovered on hopes that public pressure could lead to a new approach by authorities. More COVID outbreaks could weigh on China's economic activity in the near term, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday, adding it saw scope for a safe recalibration of policies that could allow economic growth to pick up in 2023. China's strict containment measures have dampened domestic economic activity this year and spilled over to other countries through supply chain interruptions. Following downbeat data in an official survey on Wednesday, the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index showed factory activity shrank in November for a fourth consecutive month.  While the change in tone on COVID appears a response to the public discontent with strict measures, authorities are also seeking out for questioning those present at the demonstrations. China Dissent Monitor, run by US government-funded Freedom House, estimated at least 27 demonstrations took place across China from Saturday to Monday. Australia's ASPI think tank estimated 43 protests in 22 cities."

Deadly violence has surged in the territory since March, when Israel launched near daily raids following a series of deadly attacks targeting Israelis. Palestinian sources familiar with Islamic Jihad who requested anonymity confirmed Saadi was a member of the group.

Brent crude futures fell 25 cents, or 0.3%, to $86.72 per barrel by 0430 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures eased 17 cents, or 0.2%, to $80.38. The benchmark oil contracts settled higher by over $2 on Wednesday amid a weaker dollar and optimism over Chinese demand recovery. ""The market remains uncertain about OPEC's decision, with some expecting a cut while others suggest a rollover of the current deal is more likely,"" ANZ research analysts said in a note on Thursday. The market is also bracing itself for the impact of European sanctions on Russian oil, the analysts added. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, is scheduled to meet virtually on Dec. 4. The decision to hold its meeting virtually signals little likelihood of a policy change, sources told Reuters on Wednesday, as the group assesses the impact of the looming Russian oil-price cap on the market. Meanwhile, sentiment was lifted by the shift in China's zero-COVID strategy, which raises optimism over Chinese oil demand recovery. The Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Chongqing announced an easing of COVID curbs on Wednesday, a day after demonstrators in southern Guangzhou clashed with police amid a string of protests against the world's toughest coronavirus restrictions. While fresh outbreaks in China could weigh on activity in the near term, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday that there was scope for a safe recalibration of COVID policies that could allow economic growth to pick up in 2023. However, Chinese business activity shrank further in November, official PMI data showed on Wednesday, raising fears about next year.  A slide in US crude oil inventories also limited price declines on Thursday. Crude inventories fell by 12.6 million barrels in the week to Nov. 25, higher compared with earlier analysts' expectations for a 2.8 million-barrel drop, according to the Energy Information Administration. Nonetheless, gasoline and distillate inventories rose more than expected, an indicator of easing demand. US crude oil output also surpassed 12 million barrels a day, the highest since before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the EIA said."

Car horns sounded in Tunis after the final whistle in Tunisia's 1-0 win as fans savoured the moment even though their side did not make it through to the last 16 of the Qatar World Cup, the first in an Arab country. It was the third upset by an Arab country against heavily fancied opponents, but like Saudi Arabia's win over Argentina last week it was not enough to secure a place in the next round. The Saudis fell short on Wednesday, losing 2-1 to Mexico, and host Qatar are already out, leaving one Arab team with a chance of reaching the last 16 when Morocco - who stunned second-ranked Belgium on Sunday - take on Canada on Thursday. Already the surprise Arab victories in the opening stages have been applauded across the Arab region despite its deep political divisions. ""The victory over France was wonderful and had a special taste... Arab football regained its dignity from the former colonialists countries,"" said Narredine ben Salem, sitting in the Tunis cafe where he watched the match. As the game ended, dozens of people ran into the central Habib Bourguiba Avenue, often the site of political protests, waving flags and cheering. In the official fan zone in Tunis, about 2,000 fans had been cheering through the game, many in Tunisian national soccer shirts or with their faces painted. ""It was a beautiful victory and a convincing performance but in the end it was very harsh to be knocked out,"" Ben Salem said. In Qatar, Saudi fans celebrated Tunisia's win, another show of Arab unity that has been a feature of the tournament, said Abeer Awaisha, a Tunisian fan in Qatar. Hours after Tunisia missed out on a place in the last 16, Saudi Arabia were also eliminated even though a late strike against Mexico cut their deficit to a single goal. ""It's enough that Saudi won against Argentina, that is a historic, unmatched feat,"" Saudi supporter Mashael Hussein said in Riyadh. ""It's true we were hoping to win again, but in the end we came into (the match) with national pride."" In Doha, another Saudi fan Saleem al-Harbi said Arab players had proven their quality against the best in the world. ""We hope that in the future Arab and Asian teams reach the later rounds and the final of the competition. We are able to do that and the European and Southern American teams are no different from us,"" he said. ""We are able to reach their level and be better than them."" Morocco supporter Khalim Farouki, 25, said the competition had brought Arab fans together: ""There is a big solidarity between us, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. We support each other."" Some Arab leaders attending the World Cup have echoed that sense of solidarity during matches. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - who have mended ties after years of animosity - wrapped scarves and flags of each other's country around them as they watched their matches."

""Treasury has complied with last week's court decision,"" a Treasury Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement late on Wednesday. The spokesperson declined to say whether the committee had yet accessed the documents. The development was reported earlier by CNN. The Ways and Means Committee obtained the tax returns following a Supreme Court decision clearing their release. It has been seeking the returns spanning 2015 through 2020, which it says it needs to establish whether the Internal Revenue Service is properly auditing presidential returns and whether new legislation is needed. The panel will have little time to do its work, with Republicans poised to take the House majority in January. Trump, who on Nov. 15 began his third consecutive run for the presidency, fought the committee tooth and nail to avoid releasing them. He was the first president in four decades not to release his tax returns as he sought to keep secret the details of his wealth and the activities of his real estate company, the Trump Organization. It had long been customary, though not required, for major party presidential candidates to release their returns. Trump, who served as president from 2017 to 2021, reported heavy losses from his business enterprises over several years to offset hundreds of millions of dollars in income, according to news media reporting and trial testimony about his finances. That allowed him to pay very little in taxes. A major question hanging over the committee's work is what will happen to the returns when Republicans take control of the House from the Democrats. The committee first requested Trump's returns in 2019. Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, the counterpart to the Ways and Means Committee, were considering their options on any action relating to Trump's tax returns, according to an aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. Democrats held their Senate majority in November's midterm elections."
